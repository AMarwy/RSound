This repository contains the DrRacket source code for RSound, a
cross-platform sound library.  Currently, it depends upon the
'portaudio' library, which lives in its own github repo
(jbclements/portaudio).

This bundle represents a "pkg" for Racket, and should be installed
using "raco pkg install rsound".

In version 6 of DrRacket and beyond, it should be possible to
install only rsound--the dependency will be installed automatically.
In earlier versions, you need to install portaudio (with "raco
pkg install portaudio") first. Well, by "earlier" I mean 5.3.4 and
up, because before that packages didn't even exist....

ALSO: In versions before (and possibly including) version 6, it's vital
to restart DrRacket *before* upgrading either of these packages using the
GUI interface. This is because both of these packages link to dynamic
libraries, and trying to update the packages after dynamically linking
to the library makes operating systems very unhappy.
