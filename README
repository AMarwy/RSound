This repository contains the DrRacket source code for RSound, a
cross-platform sound library.  Currently, it depends upon the
'portaudio' library, which lives in its own github repo
(jbclements/rack-portaudio).

This bundle represents a "pkg" for Racket, and should be installed
using "raco pkg install rsound".
