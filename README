This repository contains the DrRacket source code for RSound, a
cross-platform sound library.  Currently, it depends upon the
'portaudio' library.  In fact, this repo contains windows and OS X
binaries for that library.

This bundle contains the source code for a PLaneT package.  This means
that the source code thinks it's a planet package, and the best
way to use this repo (aside from simply sticking with the PLaneT
package) is to use "raco planet" to set up a development link.

More specifically, you'll probably want to use

raco planet link clements rsound.plt 1 11 /path/to/repo

BIG CAVEAT: DON'T USE ANY SYMBOLIC LINKS IN /path/to/repo. PLaneT
development links don't work well with symbolic links.

There are a bunch of other commands that will be helpful; the most
important are probably

raco planet show

... which shows you what packages you've got installed and what
development links you have installed, and

raco planet --help

... which gives you some help.
