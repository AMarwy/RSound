- try (rsound-play ding)

- try ding; it's a kind of value. A kind of value you can put into rsound-play.

- intro to numbers

- intro to operations; they all have parentheses!

- (list 60 64 67) ; it's another kind of value; a list of numbers.

- Can you put it into rsound-play? Try it! Oh dear.

- Here's a new operator: note-num-8ths. It takes a list of numbers, and
produces an rsound.

- (rsound-play (note-num-4ths (list 60 64 67 64)))

Can you figure out how the numbers are related to the music?

- make a melody!

- numbers are hard to remember. Can we give them names? yes! using "define".

- give the name "c4" to 60
- give the name "e4" to 64
- give the name "g4" to 67

- use the names rather than the numbers.

Here are some more:

g3 : 55
a3 : 57
b4 : 59

-- now, try to write the first line of "happy birthday."

- here's another operator: "reverse". It takes a list, and produces a new list in the opposite order.

-- use "reverse" to play the first line of "happy birthday" backward. Does it
sound familiar?

-- other operators: append, rsound-append, 8ths/16ths/32nds/etc.

-- other instruments: (instrument square3)

-- for rhythm: pl, on-str.
